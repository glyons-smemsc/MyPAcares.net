**Dear Pennsylvania CARES Partners,**

Thank you for your dedicated work throughout 2025 to document out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care. The data you submit is the foundation for improving survival across the Commonwealth.

As your State CARES Coordinator, I am beginning the final audit and consolidation of our **2025 data** for submission to the **National CARES Annual Report**. To ensure Pennsylvania’s performance is accurately represented and to identify our true quality improvement opportunities, we need complete and finalized data from every participating agency.

**Please take the following critical actions by Wednesday, December 31,2025 (> 20 Days away!):**

1.  **Log into your agency account at [mycares.net](https://mycares.net).**
2.  **Confirm** that all 2025 cardiac arrest cases have been entered.
3.  **Review and resolve** any data quality flags or missing fields in your submissions.
4.  **Verify** that hospital outcome linkage is complete for your cases.

**Why This Matters:**
*   **Accurate Benchmarking:** Complete data ensures we can compare our 2025 performance honestly against state and national benchmarks.
*   **Quality Improvement:** Identified gaps in the "Chain of Survival" direct where we focus CPR training, AED placement, and protocol updates for 2026.
*   **Program Sustainability:** Strong statewide participation and data quality are key factors in continued grant funding and support for the CARES program in Pennsylvania.

**Need Help?**
*   All CARES inquiries should be directed to me, including login or technical issues, contact (Gage Lyons-McCracken, PA CARES Coordinator)[mailto:glyons@smemsc.org]
*   For Pennsylvania-specific questions, data submission troubleshooting, or to schedule a quick check-in call, please reply directly to me or call me at **(814) 355-1474**.

I am available to help you overcome any final hurdles. Let’s make sure our collective effort in the field is fully reflected in the data.

Respectfully,
